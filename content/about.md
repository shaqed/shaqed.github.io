My name is Shaked Delarea and I'm a Cyber Security Researcher.

In late 2020 I joined [Argus Cyber Security](https://argus-sec.com/) as an embedded security researcher which I mostly performed security audit and penetration test on car ECUs. I gave a talk about one of my researches in [Black Hat Asia 2022](https://www.blackhat.com/asia-22/briefings/schedule/index.html#backdooring-of-real-time-automotive-os-devices-25982).

Between 2018-2020 I was doing hardware security research on embedded devices
in Ben Gurion University at the [Hardware Implementation Lab of Dr. Yossi Oren.](https://orenlab.sise.bgu.ac.il).
My M.Sc. research focused on VCC and EM fault injection attacks and finding
vulnerabilities in hardware, as well as various methods of side channel attacks
specifically aimed towards hardware. Our work, _Practical, Low-Cost Fault Injection Attacks on Personal Smart Devices_ has been published in the [Applied Sciences, Volume 12 Issue 1, 2022](mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/1/417). 

I worked as a Lecturer in the Java and Android Development at [iNT College](https://www.int-college.co.il/), the classes took place in English.

I have a M.Sc. in Computer Science and Information Systems Engineering in the Cyber Security
track of Ben Gurion University, as well as a B.Sc. in Computer Science from Sapir which I graduated with honorary distinction.
